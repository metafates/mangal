> [!CAUTION]
> As of April 2025, Mangal is no longer maintained. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who used it, contributed, or gave feedback along the way - thank you! Unfortunately, I just don't have the time to keep it going right now. That said, it's open source, so you're more than welcome to fork it, build on it, or maintain your own version. I might return to it someday, but for now, I don't recommend using it as-is - running unmaintained software can introduce security risks.

## Try it!

```shell
curl -sSL mangal.metafates.one/run | sh
```

> **Note** This script does not install anything, it just downloads, verifies and runs Mangal.
> Not available on Windows.

  __Lua 5.1__. See [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers)

- __Download & Read Manga__ - I mean, it would be strange if you couldn't, right?
- __Caching__ - Mangal will cache as much data as possible, so you don't have to wait for it to download the same data over and over again. 
- __4 Different export formats__ - PDF, CBZ, ZIP and plain images
- __TUI ✨__ - You already know how to use it! (ﾉ>ω<)ﾉ :｡･::･ﾟ’★,｡･:･ﾟ’☆
- __Scriptable__ - You can use Mangal in your scripts, it's just a CLI app after all. [Examples](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/wiki/Inline-mode)
- __History__ - Resume your reading from where you left off!
- __Fast?__ - YES.
- __Monolith__ - ZERO runtime dependencies. Even Lua is built in. Easy to install and use.
- __Cross-Platform__ - Linux, macOS, Windows, Termux, even your toaster. (¬‿¬ )
- __Anilist integration__ - Mangal will collect additional data from Anilist and use it to improve your reading experience. It can also sync your progress!

> If you wonder what those icons mean - `D` stands for "downloaded", `*` shows that chapter is marked to be downloaded.
> You can choose different icons, e.g. nerd font ones - just run mangal with `--icons nerd`.
> Available options are `nerd`, `emoji`, `kaomoji` and `squares`

### Mini

Mini mode tries to mimic [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli)

To run: `mangal mini`

![mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62389790/198830544-f2005ec4-c206-4fe0-bd08-862ffd08320e.png)

### Other

See `mangal help` for more information

## Configuration

Mangal uses [TOML](https://toml.io) format for configuration under the `mangal.toml` filename.
Config path depends on the OS.
To find yours, use `mangal where --config`.
For example, on __Linux__ it would be `~/.config/mangal/mangal.toml`.

Use env variable `MANGAL_CONFIG_PATH` to set custom config path.
> See `mangal env` to show all available env variables.

| Command               | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `mangal config get`   | Get config value for specific key                |
| `mangal config set`   | Set config value for specific key                |
| `mangal config reset` | Reset config value for specific key              |
| `mangal config info`  | List all config fields with description for each |
| `mangal config write` | Write current config to a file                   |

## Custom scrapers

TLDR; To browse and install a custom scraper
from [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers) run

    mangal sources install

Mangal has a Lua5.1 VM built-in + some useful libraries, such as headless chrome, http client, html parser and so on...

Check the [defined modules](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-lua-libs) for more information.

For scrapers examples, check the [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers)

### Creating a custom scraper

This command will create `example.lua` file in the `mangal where --sources` directory.

    mangal sources gen --name example --url https://example.com

Open the file and edit it as you wish.
Take a look at the comments for more information.
See [mangal-scrapers repository](https://github.com/metafates/mangal-scrapers) for examples.

You can test it by running `mangal run <filepath>`

It should automatically appear in the list of available scrapers.

## Anilist

Mangal also supports integration with anilist.

Besides fetching metadata for each manga when downloading,
mangal can also mark chapters as read on your Anilist profile when you read them inside mangal.

For more information see [wiki](https://github.com/metafates/mangal/wiki/Anilist-Integration)
